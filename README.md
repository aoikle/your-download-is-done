Your Download is Done - Add-on for Chrome Browser

Makes a ding sound when a download is finished. Nothing more. Nothing less.
This ridiculously small extension just makes a ding sound when your download is completed.  No longer do you need to keep checking the progress of your download.  Perfect for long downloads and when you need to be away from the computer for a while.
